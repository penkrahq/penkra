Framework-neutral APIs for Apps running inside Penkra. The package contains manifest validation,
typed operations, tab routing, settings, secrets, identity, permissions, mediated
network and file access, hosted browser and simulator sessions, and native context menus. Each
visual tab runs in its own sandboxed, cross-origin App×Space iframe. Penkra injects the public SDK
bootstrap and binds it to the exact tab with a `MessagePort`; visual Apps never receive Electron,
Node globals, raw IPC, or ambient filesystem access. An optional operation entrypoint runs
separately in a dedicated Node controller and may use ordinary Node facilities.

```ts
import { defineApp } from "@penkra/sdk";
import { tab } from "@penkra/sdk/tab";

export const manifest = defineApp({
  id: "com.example.notes",
  slug: "notes",
  name: "Notes",
  summary: "Keep project notes.",
  version: "1.0.0",
  compatibility: { penkra: ">=0.8.0" },
  icons: [{ src: "icon.svg", sizes: "any", type: "image/svg+xml" }],
  entrypoints: { tab: "app.html" },
});

// When navigation begins inside the App, record the current route for restoration.
await tab.setRoute({ route: "/note", state: { noteId: "note-123" } });
```

`tab.setRoute` records the visual App's current route and state without navigating it or calling its
`tab.onNavigate` handler. Penkra restores the latest recorded route after an App update or host
restart. `tab.onNavigate` receives navigation initiated outside the App.

Apps may use any browser-compatible framework. React is optional and available from
`@penkra/sdk/react`. Visual runtime exports come from `@penkra/sdk/tab` and require a live visual
App tab. A Node operation controller imports `@penkra/sdk/controller` and receives the narrower
`PenkraControllerRuntimeApi`: operation registration, invocation
context, Account requests, settings, secrets, identity, and permission queries. Controllers use
ordinary Node APIs for filesystem, HTTP, crypto, Buffer, and stream work. Ordinary unit tests should
test App logic separately. Penkra exposes the real isolated-host runner through the registered
`{ "command": "penkra app test --directory <directory>" }` invocation in `penkra_exec_command`.

```ts
import { operations } from "@penkra/sdk/controller";

operations.handle("documents.read", async ({ id }, context) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://<service-host>/documents/${encodeURIComponent(id)}`, {
    signal: context.signal,
  });
  return response.json();
});
```

Use `contextMenu.show(...)` from a direct pointer interaction when an App needs a platform-native
right-click menu. Penkra returns the selected item ID or `null`; Apps never receive Electron menu
objects.

In a visual tab, files and directories use `files.pick("file" | "directory" | "save")` and opaque
App×Space-scoped handle IDs.
The host validates every descendant and symlink boundary and never reveals an absolute path.
Handles survive iframe reload but currently expire when the desktop runtime restarts; there is no
filesystem manifest permission or ambient filesystem namespace. Apps may also declare exact
`open-file` extensions or `open-directory`; trusted host openings deliver the same kind of scoped
handle to the declared operation. Use `readBinary` for bounded reads and the
`beginWrite` / `writeChunk` / `commitWrite` session for larger atomic writes; abort unfinished
writes when App-side work fails.

For visual-tab bulk bytes, `files.open` and `storage.open` return revocable same-origin URLs suitable
for `fetch`, images, audio, and ranged video playback. Network uploads and downloads involving an
opaque handle or App storage use permission-gated `transfer.begin`, `transfer.send`, and
`transfer.receive`; subscribe with `transfer.onProgress` for host-measured remote progress. Bulk
bytes do not cross renderer RPC. Do not use these renderer services from `operations.js`; use
ordinary Node HTTP, filesystem, and stream APIs there.

Privileged Penkra APIs require matching manifest declarations and per-Space grants. Hosted browser
APIs require `browser-session`, and hosted simulated-device APIs require `simulator-session`. Both
are scoped to the calling App and Space and cannot address another App or Space's session.

External Account identity requires the high-risk `account-identity` permission with a manifest
`audience`. `identity.getToken({ audience })` returns a five-minute, audience-bound JWT only when
the argument exactly matches that declaration. See `docs/app-development.md` in the Penkra
repository for development identity, backend verification, and key rotation.

The Browser page is host-owned while the App owns its surrounding chrome. Call
`browser.setSurfaceLayout({ top, right, bottom, left })` with App-local edge insets, or `null` when
the page surface is hidden. Insets describe structural layout and should remain unchanged during a
plain panel resize; do not stream measured width and height through the runtime bridge.
